<h3>Viewing data in 2D</h3>

<h4>Raster data symbology</h4>
Display land use classes using custom color, add labels:

<pre>
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Browse to C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\582data\ncrast.gdb
select 'landcl96'
'OK'
RMC landcl96->Symbology
In the 'symbology' pane, in the Label column, LMC on the label number to replace numbers 1-7 with these labels, respectively:
developed
agriculture
herbaceous
shrubland
forest
water
sediment

In the 'symbology' pane, LMC on the color column boxes and replace the color for each land use with a more intuitive one.
</pre>

<p>
Save as layer to preserve the new color scheme and labels:

<pre>
RMC on the landcl96 entry in the Contents ->'Sharing'->'Save as layer file...'
Save as landcl96.lyr in your assignment folder
</pre>

<p>
Display only categories 1 and 2 from the land use map:

<pre>
RMC landcl96->Symbology
In the 'symbology' pane, LMC to select items 3 - 7 (herbaceous - sediment)

</pre>

<p>
Add a legend<br>

<pre>
On the 'Insert' tab in the 'Map Surrounds' group, click 'Legend'
Click and drag on the layout to create the legend
RMC on your new legend->Properties.  A new 'Element' pane will open
In the legend/Element pane, Click to show on legend title
Replace the text "Legend" with "Land Classification" 

On the 'Display' tab of the element pane
Add a Legend Frame Border (select one as you feel appropriate)
Add a white Frame Background. Set the cap to X:0.1in and Y:0.1in (as in the Frame Border)
Adjust the border x and y gap to 0.1 in each
Drag the legend to a more appropriate location, and resize it to make it "fit" into your map.
</pre>

<p>
Add a scale bar:

<pre>
On the 'Insert' tab, in the 'Map Surrounds' group, click the 'Scale Bar' button
Select a scale bar (your choice)
Click and drag on the layout to create the scale bar.
RMC on the scale bar-> Properties 
In the 'Element' pane, set Division Units to kilometers

Browse to C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\582data\ncshape.gdb
select 'roadsmajor'
'OK'
RMC roadsmajor->Symbology
Click the symbol line to open the 'Format line symbol' option
Search or browse the 'Gallery' and change the symbol to Expressway 
Select roadmajor in the contents pane. On the ribbon, under Feature Layer, click the Labeling tab, and click 'Label'
In the 'Label class' group, select 'Road_Name' from the dropdown.
Change the font and size in the 'Text Symbol' group.
Use the 'Label placement' group to select 'North American Streets'

Or, RMC roadsmajor->Labeling Properties
Language should be 'Arcade'
Expression $feature.ROAD_NAME
Font, size and placement options can be changed in this pane as well.
Find and use the 'Halo' option under 'Symbol'

Export the layout to pdf
Share tab on the ribbon->export group->layout
</pre>

<h4>Compare hillshades</h4>

<p>
<pre>
Go back to the Map window and remove all the layers from TOC (or you can create a new project)
Add 'elev' from the ncrast geodatabase
Change the color ramp for elev to an appropriate elevation color scheme
</pre>
<p>
Compare different types of hillshade effects from an elevation map
<p> 1. Hillshade generated using the 3D Analyst Extension.

<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the "hillshade" tool.
Select elev as input, hillsh_el as output, z factor=3
Click 'Run'
The new hillshade should have been added to the contents pane above your elev raster
If not, drag the hillshade above the elev raster
Change the Hillshade to 50% transparency
</pre>

<p>
2. Hillshade generated with the "Raster Functions" tool:

<pre>
On the Analysis ribbon --> Raster group->'Raster Functions' pane
Expand the Surface functions and select the Hillshade option (or search for Hillshade in the Raster Functions pane).
Select 'elev' as the raster
Set the Z to 3 to exaggerate the height variation in the terrain
Click 'Create new layer' to create a new layer in the current map.
(Note that this is only a new display of the processed dataâ€”it is not a new raster dataset)
The new hillshade should have been added to the contents pane above your elev raster
If not, drag the hillshade above the elev raster
Change the Hillshade to 50% transparency
</pre>

<p>
To examine the differences, zoom into an area of the data and toggle the hillshade layer
on and off (by repetitively checking and unchecking the layer in the TOC). The rapid image interchange emphasizes differences.
<p>
In order to copare the results with elev with no hillshade applied you can load the elev layer again, without checking the hillshade effect in Symbology tab 

<h3>Viewing data in 3D using a Scene</h3>
In ArcGIS Pro, a 3D map is called a scene. 
A scene can be viewed in either global or local mode. 
Global mode is best for very large study areas. Local mode is best for smaller study areas. 
You can view any scene as a global scene or a local scene by clicking the Global button or the Local button in the View group on the View tab.
Start a Local Scene:

<pre>
With the 'elev' raster still in the map
View tab on the ribbon->view->convert->'To Local Scene'
A new 'Map_3d' window tab should open
</pre>

<p>
Or create a new Local Scene:

<pre>
Start a new projectSelect 'Local Scene' from the templates
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Add 'ncrast.gdb\elev'
</pre>

<p>
Display 2-dimensional data as a 3-D surface (to render in 3-D):

Add a ground elevation surface:
<pre>
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'->'Elevation source'
Add 'ncrast.gdb\elev'
</pre>

<p>
To change the vertical exaggeration (z-value multiplier, default is 1) for a layer:

<pre>
In the Contents pane, under Elevation Surfaces, click Ground
The Elevation Surface contextual tab set appears on the ribbon
Under Elevation Surface, click the Appearance tab
In the Drawing group, for Vertical Exaggeration, type 10
</pre>

<p>
Drape a vector feature over the 3-D (raster) surface:

<pre>
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Add  'ncshape.gdb\streets_wake'
It may add the layer to the 3d layers in the contents pane.  
If so, Drag the layer to the 2d Layers group above 'elev'
</pre>

<p>
this action will both drape the vector streets on the raster surface,
and clip the extent of the much larger streets data to that of the surface.

Change the color ramp for a layer:

<pre>
RMC 'elev'-> Symbology
Use the 'Gallery' tab to scroll through the available ESRI-provided ramps.
Choose one of the color ramps
</pre>

<p>
Change the background color (useful for enhancing visualization).

<pre>
RMC 'Scene' in the 'Contents' pane->Properties ***May be Map_3d instead of scene***
Go to the 'General' tab
Choose the black color patch from the color palette drop-down menu
Click 'OK'.
</pre>

<p>
Adjust the direction (azimuth and altitude) and contrast of the light applied the surface:

<pre>
Reset the background color to white (refer to previous task)
In the 'Contents' pane, under 'Elevation Surfaces', click 'Ground'
The 'Elevation Surface' contextual tab set appears on the ribbon
In the 'Surface' group, Check 'Shade relative to light position'

RMC 'Map_3d' in the 'Contents' pane->Properties
Go to the 'Illumination' tab
Reposition the light source by changing altitude and azimuth
Click 'OK'
</pre>
<p>


<p>
Adjust the lighting contrast:

<pre>
RMC 'Map_3d' in the 'Contents' pane->Properties
Go to the 'Illumination' tab
Use the contrast slider to adjust contrast value
Click 'OK'
</pre>
