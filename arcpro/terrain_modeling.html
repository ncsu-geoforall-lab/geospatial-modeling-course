<h3>Bring lidar data into ArcGIS</h3>
There are multiple ways of handling lidar data in ArcGIS. We will use LAS datasets and multipoint files. For other workflows refer to the FYI section at the end of the assignment 

<h3>Analyze multiple return lidar data</h3>
<h4>Create a LAS dataset from .las point cloud</h4>
LAS datasets provide a way to quickly view the properties of a point cloud. You can also use binning or TINs to create a DSM or DEM. This is especially useful if you want to process several .las files at once.
<pre>In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Create LAS Dataset' tool
Set 'Input Files' to 'tile_0793_016_spm.las'
Set 'Output LAS Dataset' to 'lidar_all'
Be sure'Coordinate System' is set to 'NAD_1983_HARN_StatePlane_North_Carolina_FIPS_3200' (you can type 3358 in search window)
Check 'Compute Statistics'
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<h4>View LAS dataset properties and filter points</h4>
<pre>In the Catalog pane, Right click on the LAS dataset and select 'Properties...'
Select the 'LAS Files' tab and take note of average point spacing (will use in later step).
Select the 'Statistics' tab to view point statistics by returns and classes.
Click 'Ok'</pre>
<span class="question">What percentage of the points are classified as ground? </span>
<pre>Right click on the LAS dataset in the Contents pane and click 'Properties...'
Select 'LAS Filter' tab.
Try applying several filter settings using classes and returns and view the results.
Check box next to '2 Ground' under 'Classification Codes'</pre>
<span class="question">What is the difference between 'Last Return' and 'Last of Many'?</span>

<p>With the LAS dataset filtered for ground points only, now we can analyze the point density of ground points and create a DEM with binning.
<p>
<h4>Compute a raster map representing number of points per cell (at two different resolutions)</h4>
Calculate point density at 2m resolution:
<pre>In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'LAS Point Statistics as Raster' tool
Set 'Input LAS' to 'lidar_all'
Set 'Output Raster' to 'ground_count2m'
Set 'Method' to 'POINT_COUNT'
Set 'Sampling Type' to 'CELLSIZE'
Set 'Sampling Value' to '2'                            
Click 'RUN'
Right click on resulting raster in Contents and select 'Symbology'
Change color scheme to something appropriate.
On the 'Mask' tab, Set 'NoData' to red to highlight any areas with zero points.
</pre>

<p>
Calculate point density at 6m resolution:
(remember the tip with the geoprocessing history)
<pre>In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'LAS Point Statistics as Raster' tool
Set 'Input LAS' to 'lidar_all'
Set 'Output Raster' to 'ground_count6m'
Set 'Method' to 'POINT_COUNT'
Set 'Sampling Type' to 'CELLSIZE'
Set 'Sampling Value' to '6'                            
Click 'Run'
Right click on resulting raster in Contents and select 'Symbology'
Change color scheme to something appropriate.
On the 'Mask' tab, Set 'NoData' to red to highlight any areas with zero points.
</pre>

<h4>Compute a raster map representing range of elevation values per cell at 6m resolution</h4>

<pre>In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'LAS Point Statistics as Raster' tool
Set 'Input LAS' to 'lidar_all'
Set 'Output Raster' to 'ground_range6m'
Set 'Method' to 'Range of Elevation Values'
Set 'Sampling Type' to 'CELLSIZE'
Set 'Sampling Value' to '6'                            
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<h4>Use binning to compute a raster map representing average elevation per cell for ground points</h4>
<span class="question">Based on the point density rasters created in the previous steps, what would be an appropriate resolution for binning the ground points? What does the range raster tell you about binning at this resolution?</span>

<pre>
Ensure that the LAS dataset is still filtered to include only class 2 (ground) points.
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'LAS Dataset to Raster' tool
Set 'Input LAS Dataset' to 'lidar_all'
Set 'Output Raster' to 'ground_mean6m'
Set 'Value field' to 'ELEVATION'
Set 'Interpolation Type' to 'Binning'
Set 'Cell Assignment Type' to 'Average'
Set 'Void Fill Method' to 'LINEAR'
Set 'Sampling Type' to 'CELLSIZE'
Set 'Sampling Value' to '6'   
Set 'Z factor' to '1'                         
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<h3>Use multipoint file to interpolate DSM from multiple return lidar data</h3>
LAS to multipoint can be used to create a vector point file from a point cloud. The points can be filtered by class or return and then interpolated to create a raster.

<p>Add some background data to give context:

<pre>
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Browse to C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\582data\ncshape.gdb
select  streets_wake
Select lakes
Select streams
</pre>
<p>
Display orthophoto:

<pre>
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Browse to C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\582data
select ortho_0793_016_ncspm.tif
</pre>

<h4>Create Multipoint files from .las point cloud and interpolate DSM</h4>
<pre>In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'LAS to Multipoint' tool
Set 'Input' to 'tile_0793_016_spm.las'
Set 'Output ' to 'lidar_first'
Set 'Average Point Spacing' to value listed in Files tab of LAS dataset properties, noted earlier.
Leave the 'Class Codes' empty
For 'Return Value', uncheck 'ALL_RETURNS' and check '1'
Set 'Coordinate System' to 'NAD_1983_StatePlane_North_Carolina_FIPS_3200' (you can type 3358 in the search window)
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<p>
Interpolate DSM:

<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Radial Basis Functions' tool
Set 'Input features' to 'lidar_first'
Set 'Z field' to 'Shape.Z'
Set 'Output raster' to 'lidar_spline'
Set 'Radial basis function' to 'Spline with Tension'
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<p>
Find out what areas have multiple returns:
<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'LAS to Multipoint' tool
Set 'Input' to 'tile_0793_016_spm.las'
Set 'Output ' to 'lidar_multi'
Fill the rest as before but in 'Return values', uncheck 'All_RETURNS' and check values greater than 1. (2-8)
</pre>

Overlay result with orthophoto. <span class="question">Where do we have multiple returns?</span>

<h3>Optional - display the multiple return data as points in a Scene</h3>
(Hint, look back at the 'Data visualization' assignment)

<h3>FYI: Handling LAS data in ArcGIS</h3>
There are three different formats (datasets) that can be used to manage and work with your lidar data in ArcGIS Pro
<h4>1. LAS Dataset or LAS file</h4>
<h4>2. Mosaic dataset</h4>
<h4>3. POint cloud scene layer</h4>
