<h3>Compute soil detachment rate using USLE3D</h3>

Compute a map of soil detachment rate using USLE3D equation which assumes that there is no deposition.<br>
This represents detachment limited sediment transport by overland flow.<br>
<pre>
E = RKLSCP
</pre>
<p>where
<ul>
<li>E is the annual soil detachment rate (soil loss)</li>
<li>R is the rainfall</li>
<li>K is the soil</li>
<li>C is the land cover</li>
<li>P is the preventive measures factor</li>
<li>LS = 1.4 * (U/22.1)**0.4 * (sin (slope)/0.09)**1.2<br>
LS is the topography factor, U is contributing area per unit width (function of flow accumulation)</li>
</ul>
<p>
For units and explanation of constants see <a href="../resources/erosion_notes.pdf"><b>Erosion modeling notes</b></a><br>

<p>
First compute slope, and flow accumulation for the elevation raster map e_lid792 (NOT elid_792):
--Leave other values defaul if not specified--
<pre>
In the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Browse to C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\582data\ncrast.gdb
select 'e_lid792'  (NOT elid_792)
"Ok"
</pre>

<p>
Compute slope_1m map using the Slope function, we will use it later:

<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Slope' tool
input'e_lid792
output=slope_1m
Keep 'DEGREES' for output measurement
</pre>

<p>
Compute the flow accumulation map Flowacc:
<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Fill' tool
input=e_lid792 
output=Fill_e_lid

In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Flow Direction' tool
input=Fill_e_lid 
ouput=FlowDir_fil

In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Flow Accumulation' tool
input=FlowDir_fil 
output=Flowacc
</pre>

<h4>LS factor</h4>
Build an expression in the Spatial Analyst Raster Calculator for lsfac map
using the Flowacc and slope_1m layers you just generated.<br>
<p>
Note that the lsfac map represents the topographic factor LS used in the USLE3D model.<br>
Flowacc map multiplied by resolution is the contributing area per unit width U.

<p>
Type in the expression for lsfac layer (make sure you have spaces around operators).<br>
Slope should be in radians,
flowaccumulation is in number of cells so we multiply by resolution:

<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Raster Calculator' tool
expression=
1.4 * (Power("Flowacc" * 1. / 22.1 , 0.4) * Power(Sin("slope_1m" * math.pi/180.0) / 0.09, 1.2))
Set the 'output raster' to 'lsfac'
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<h4>Soil loss</h4>

Now build the expression for soil detachment rate E (soil loss) s_loss. From the formula
<pre>
E = RKLSCP
</pre>
We computed LS factor
R factor is considered to be constant and set to 270.0
K factor values can be added as a layer ncrast.gdb/soils_kf
C factior values can be added as a layer ncrast.gdb/cfactb
P factor (prevention measures) is here taken to = 1.
<p>
Multiplying all the factors in Raster Calculator we will compute the raster map of erosion rate
<pre>
Add ncrast.gdb/soils_kf
Add ncrast.gdb/cfactb
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Raster Calculator' tool
expression=
270.0 * "cfactb" * "lsfac" * "soils_kf"
Set the 'output raster' to 's_loss'
</pre>

Adjust color scheme for the s_loss map - histogram equalized stretch type may be needed
<span class="question">Find average soil loss rate in the area from the s_loss map</span> (in Properties:Source).

<h3>USPED model</h3>
Compute net erosion and deposition as a divergence of sediment flow vector field.<br>
Note that custom color tables that cover entire range of values
including negative are important in this section.

<p>
We have already computed slope_1m and flowaccumulation, but we will also need direction of flow.<br>
Compute aspect_1m map (direction of flow, direction of gradient vector) using the Aspect function:

<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Aspect'
input=e_lid792 
output=aspect_1m
</pre>

<p>
Build an expression for sflowtopo (topographic factor LS for sediment flow T)
using the Raster Calculator.<br>
For the exponents use m=n=1, resolution is 1.

<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Raster Calculator' tool
expression=
"Flowacc" * 1. * Sin("slope_1m" * math.pi/180.0)
output raster = sflowtopo
</pre>

<p>
OR use m=1.3 and n=1.2 for study areas with extensive rills.<br>
In this case, channels/streams will have large erosion rates due to high values of flowaccumulation.


<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Raster Calculator' tool
expression=
(Power("Flowacc" * 1. , 1.3) * Power((Sin("slope_1m" * math.pi/180.0)), 1.2))
output raster = sflowtopo2
</pre>

<h4>Compute divergence of sediment flow</h4>
First compute components of sediment flow in x and y direction:
Calculate qsx
<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Raster Calculator' tool
expression=
"sflowtopo" * "soils_kf" * "cfactb" * 270. * Cos((- "aspect_1m" + 450.) * math.pi / 180.0)
Output raster = qsx
</pre>
Calculate qsy
<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Raster Calculator' tool
expression=
"sflowtopo" * "soils_kf" * "cfactb" * 270. * Sin((- "aspect_1m" + 450.) * math.pi / 180.0)
Output raster = qsy
</pre>

<p>
Compute components of change in sediment flow in x and y direction
as partial derivatives of sediment flow field, derived from slope and aspect
 - see eqs 1,2,3 from <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hmitaso/gmslab/reports/cerl99/rep99.html">here</a>.

<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Slope' tool
input=qsx
output=Slope_qsx
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Aspect' tool
input=qsx
output=Aspect_qsx
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Slope' tool
input=qsy
output=Slope_qsy
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Aspect' tool
input=qsy
output=Aspect_qsy
</pre>
Compute qsx_dx and qsy_dy
<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Raster Calculator' tool
expression=
Cos((- "Aspect_qsx" + 450) * math.pi / 180.0) * Tan("Slope_qsx" * math.pi/180.0)
output=qsx_dx
expression=
Sin((- "Aspect_qsy" + 450) * math.pi / 180.0) * Tan("Slope_qsy" * math.pi/180.0)
output=qsy_dy
</pre>

<p>
Finally compute net erosion deposition:

<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Raster Calculator' tool
expression="qsx_dx" + "qsy_dy"
output=erdep
</pre>

<p>
Assign an appropriate color classification scheme to the erdep raster and generate a map for the report.<br>

Note: the differences in the erdep are subtle and the default color table will almost assuredly render<br>
the erosion deposition map in a way that little detail is revealed. <br>
You are free to experiment with the the tools in Arc in order to define classification scheme which will
reveal the erosion/deposition pattern.<br>
Here's an option that should yield pretty good contrast between erosion and deposition:

<pre>
RMC the erdep layer->Symbology
Select 'Classify' from 'Primary symbology'
Set Classes to 11
Choose a broad, divergent color ramp from the Color Scheme drop down field
that ranges from brown grading through white to green (brown-green continuous)
Edit the eleven break values (located in the classes tab) to:
-250000.00  (data minimum)
-50.00
-5.00
-1.00
-0.10
0.10
1.00
5.00
50.00
330000.00    (data maximum)
</pre>

You should now see the erosion and deposition areas rendered with pretty good contrast.
