<h3>Interpolation using splines</h3>
Interpolate elevation surfaces from spot point heights using the Spline tool 
in the Spatial Analyst toolbox.<br>
Use three different weights (0.1, 1, 1000) to control the tension, and thus, the resulting surface character.<br>
For the first interpolation, you'll leave the Weight field blank, accepting the default 0.1 value.<br>
In subsequent interpolations, you'll enter the explicit weights.

<pre>
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Browse to C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\582data\ncshape.gdb
select elev_lid792_randpts
'OK'

In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Spline' tool
Set 'Input Point Features' to 'elev_lid792_randpts'
Set 'Z value field' to 'value_'
Set 'Output Raster' to 'elev_tps'
Set 'Output cell size' to '2'
Set to Spline Type to 'TENSION'
Leave the other inputs as defaults 
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<p>
Evaluate impact of interpolation function parameters on the resulting surface
using hillshade.
<p>

<pre>
Top ribbon->Analysis->Geoprocessing Group->Raster Analysis->cell size
enter '2' for cell size
Click 'OK'
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Hillshade' tool
Set 'Input raster' to 'elev_tps'
Set 'Output Raster' to 'Hillsh_tps'
Leave the other inputs as defaults
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<p>
Repeat the spline interpolations above, using weights of 1 and then 1000,<br>
and generate the associated hill shade surfaces.<br>
Compare the three hill shade surfaces, and discuss your findings in your report.<br>
(Tip, use the 'history' tab to reload and change values for previously run geoprocessing tools)   

<h3>Interpolate surface using Radial Basis Functions</h3>
Use the Geostatistical Analyst tool's Radial Basis Functions to generate at least
two different elevation surfaces by selecting different Kernel functions.<br>
In the first surface you'll use the RBF multi-quadric method.<br>
In the second, you'll choose Regularized Spline.

<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Radial Basis Functions' tool
Set the 'input features' to 'elev_lid792_randpts'
Set the 'Z value' to 'value_'
Set the 'output raster' to 'elev_lid792_multi'
Set the Radial basis function to 'Multiquadric'
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<p>
Rerun the interpolation in the Radial Basis Functions tool using<br>
Kernal Type = Completely Regularized Spline and compare your results.
