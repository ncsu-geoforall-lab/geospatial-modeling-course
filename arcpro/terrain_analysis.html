<p>
Create the assignment working directory (folder) .\Analysis.<br>
Start ArcMap.<br>
Disable background processing.


<pre>
Start->Programs->ArcGIS->ArcMap
Geoprocessing -> Geoporocessing Options... -> Uncheck "Enable" Background Processing

<h3>Compute basic topographic parameters from 10m NED</h3>

<pre>
In ArcMap
Select File->Add Data->Add Data...
Select ncrast.mdb/elev
Check out a Spatial Analyst Extension license
Open the ArcToolbox
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->Slope'
Set 'Input raster' to 'elev'
Set 'Output raster' to '.\Analysis\Slope_elev'
Set 'Output measurement' to 'DEGREE'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Do the same for Aspect and Curvature<br>
Try to create a meaningful diverging color table for curvatures
with two color shades and light color in the middle.

<h3>Compute topographic parameters from SRTM DEM and compare with NED</h3>

<pre>
In ArcMap
Select File->Add Data->Add Data...
Select ncrast.mdb/elev_srt
Open the ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Surface->Slope'
Set 'Input raster' to 'elev_srt'
Set 'Output raster' to '.\Analysis\Slope_el_srt'
Set 'Output measurement' to 'DEGREE'
Click 'OK'

<i>right mouse click</i> 'Slope_el_srt->Properties->Symbology->Classify 
</pre>

<p>
Compare mean and stddev in Classification statistics with 10m NED derived slope.<br>
<span class="question">Explain the differences between slope from 10m NED and 30m SRTM.</span>

<h3>Compare slope and aspect, from TIN and from 1m raster DEM</h3>
Use a previously created TIN or create a new one,<br>
see the first assignment of two covering the topic of Spatial interpolation.

<pre>
In ArcMap
Select File->Add Data->Add Data...
Select ncshape.mdb/elev_lid792_randpts
</pre>

<p>
Create TIN 'tin' in 3D Analyst from these points if you don't have it already:

<pre>
Open ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select 3D Analyst Tools->Data Management->TIN->Create TIN
Set 'Output TIN' to .\Analysis\lid792_tin
Set 'Input feature class' to elev_lid792_randpts
In the Input feature class list, find the "height_field" (2nd field from left). 
Click on the entry for the elev_lid792_randpts (Shape_Z is displayed by default). 
By clicking on the field it should convert to a drop-down list. 
Click the down arrow to display your list of options and select "Value_".  
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
<!-- # compute slope
Open the ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select '3D Analyst Tools-> terrain and TIN Surface -> Surface Slope'
Set 'Input Surface' to 'lid792_tin'
Set 'Output Feature Class' as '.\Analysis\lid792_tin_SurfaceSlope' 
Set 'Slope Units' to 'DEGREE'
Click 'OK'

# do the same for Surface Aspect to create: '.\Analysis\lid792_tin_SurfaceAspect' -->
Compute slope.<br>
The output from this process is a polygon feature class whose attribute (found
in the slope class field) consists of the slopes binned into 7 classes.<br>
The default (ESRI) breaks (bins) are at 0.57, 1.43, 2.66, 5.71, 12.13, 24.89,
45.0, 90.0.

<pre>
Open the ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select '3D Analyst Tools-> Triangulated Surface -> Surface Slope'
Set 'Input Surface' to 'lid792_tin'
Set 'Output Feature Class' as '.\Analysis\lid792_tin_SurfaceSlope' 
Set 'Slope Units' to 'DEGREE'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Do the same for Surface Aspect to create: '.\Analysis\lid792_tin_SurfaceAspect'.<br>
As with slope, the aspect that comes from this process is in the form of a
polygon feature class whose aspect attribute is binned into eight 45 degree wide<br>
directions (code = 1 - 8 ).<br>
These are: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW, respectively.<br>
Assign suitable colors to the slope and aspect polygons.

<p>
Derive slope from 1m raster DEM:

<pre>
Select File->Add Data->Add Data...
Select ncrast.mdb/elid_792
Open the ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select '3D Analyst Tools -> Raster Surface -> Slope'
Set 'Input raster' to 'elid_792'
Set 'Output raster' to '.\Analysis\slope_elid72'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Choose similar color table as for the TIN. To get more continuous color table:

<pre>
<i>right mouse click</i> 'Slope_elid72' 
Select 'Properties -> Symbology"
Change Classes to 32
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Compute the aspect and curvature.<br>
For curvature change the color table to one that has lighter break in the middle.<br>
<span class="question">Compare the resulting slope, aspect and curvature with the topographic parameters derived from TIN.</span>
