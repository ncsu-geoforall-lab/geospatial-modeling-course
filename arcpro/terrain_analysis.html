Launch ArcGIS Pro and login with ArcGIS Online credentials if required.
Select New> Map> Create New Project.
Create a new project in your preferred workspace,
in the instructions below we are using the default C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\Projects\ folder.
<p>
Use your judgement to decide which maps to include in your report.

<h3>Compute basic topographic parameters from 10m NED</h3>

<pre>
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Browse to C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\582data\ncrast.gdb
select 'elev'
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Slope' tool
Set 'Input raster' to 'elev'
Set 'Output raster' to 'Slope_elev'
Set 'Output measurement' to 'DEGREE'
Leave other fields as defaults
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<p>
Do the same for Aspect and Curvature<br>
Try to create a meaningful diverging color table for curvatures
with two color shades and light color in the middle.

<h3>Compute topographic parameters from SRTM DEM and compare with NED</h3>

<pre>
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Browse to C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\582data\ncrast.gdb
select 'elev_srt'
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Slope' tool
Set 'Input raster' to 'elev_srt'
Set 'Output raster' to '.\Analysis\Slope_el_srt'
Set 'Output measurement' to 'DEGREE'
Leave other fields as defaults
Click 'Run'

<i>right mouse click</i> 'Slope_el_srt->Symbology->primary symbology 'Classify' 
Classes tab->more->'Show Statistics'
</pre>

<p>
Compare mean and stddev in Classification statistics with 10m NED derived slope.<br>
<span class="question">Explain the differences between slope from 10m NED and 30m SRTM.</span>

<h3>Compare slope and aspect, from TIN and from 1m raster DEM</h3>
Use a previously created TIN or create a new one,<br>
see the first assignment of two covering the topic of Spatial interpolation.

<pre>
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Browse to C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\582data\ncshape.gdb
select elev_lid792_randpts
'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Create TIN 'tin' in 3D Analyst from these points if you don't have it already:

<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Create TIN' tool
Set 'Output TIN' to 'lid792_TIN'
Set Input Feature Class to 'elev_lid792_randpts'
Set the 'height field' to 'value_'
Set 'Type' to 'Mass_Points'
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<p>
Compute slope.<br>
<pre>
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Surface Slope' tool
Set 'Input Surface' to 'lid792_tin'
Set 'Output Feature Class' as 'tin_SurfaceSlope' 
Set 'Slope Units' to 'DEGREE'
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<p>
Do the same for Surface Aspect to create: 'tin_SurfaceAspect'.<br>

<p>
Derive slope from 1m raster DEM:

<pre>
On the Map tab, in the Layer group, click 'Add Data'
Browse to C:\Users\myname\Documents\ArcGIS\582data\ncrast.gdb
select 'e_lid_792'
In the Geoprocessing pane, search for and select the 'Slope' tool
Set 'Input raster' to 'e_lid_792'
Set 'Output raster' to 'slope_elid72'
Click 'Run'
</pre>

<p>
Choose similar color table as for the TIN. To get more continuous color table:

<pre>
<i>right mouse click</i> 'Slope_elid72' 
Select 'Symbology'
Method "Natural Breaks'
Change Classes to 32
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Compute the aspect and curvature.<br>
For curvature change the color table to one that has lighter break in the middle.<br>
<span class="question">Compare the resulting slope, aspect and curvature with the topographic parameters derived from TIN.</span>
