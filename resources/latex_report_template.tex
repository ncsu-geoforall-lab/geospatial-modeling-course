\section*{Introduction}

Task, motivation. Do not use the text from this example, it is for formatting only!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Methods}

We list the raster and vector data using the layer management tools and display
the selected layers at appropriate spatial extent and resolution.
We set the spatial extent for our study area and define resolution at 30m\ldots\ and
display raster and vector data using the default color maps and basic line symbols.
We use the metadata information stored with each map layer to identify
the original raster data resolution, spatial extent and range of values\ldots


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Results}

The data set includes raster and vector data layers for North Carolina (\ref{fig:afigure})
at several spatial extents and resolutions\ldots

The elevation and road map for the study area is in the Fig. 1\ldots\ The state wide DEM
and climate data points are in Fig. 10\ldots \emph{(See the page \pageref{fig:figure-internal-label} and further
for suggestion on how to arrange your figures. Two images in row are usually the right choice,
e.g. figure \ref{fig:twotwo})}

We set the computational region to match the raster elevation
\emph{(When showing textual output of a module, use environment verbatim which uses monospace font)}:
\begin{verbatim}
projection: 99 (Lambert Conformal Conic)
zone:       0
datum:      nad83
ellipsoid:  a=6378137 es=0.006694380022900787
north:      734132.59185159
south:      731672.4061379
west:       2092185.68036389
east:       2094646.84229405
nsres:      6.00045296
ewres:      6.00283398
rows:       410
cols:       410
cells:      168100
\end{verbatim}
For emphasis use \verb|\emph{...}| command and for short text which should be shown
verbatim in monospace font use command \verb|\verb+...+| or \verb+\verb|...|+.

\section*{Discussion}

Displaying the data in both systems was straightforward. The default color table
for the elevation data was fuzzy, classification into fewer discrete classes
in ArcGIS or conversion to integers brings out the contours (choropleths?).
More detailed representation was achieved by relief shading.
I could get GRASS to display points using the circle symbol --- I was getting the following error.
It was impossible to find where to set the resolution when displaying the elevation data in ArcGIS\ldots


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{What I learned}

I got familiar with GRASS basics and with the data set.
I learned how to identify the resolution of my raster data in ArcGIS
and that it can be different from the resolution of the displayed raster.
