   <h3>Inverse distance weighted method</h3>
<p>
Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation (IDW):
<ul>
<li class="fragment">the simplest and most common method
<li class="fragment">value at an unsampled point is a weighted average of  values at nearby measured points

   <h3>Inverse distance weighted method</h3>
<p>
Value at a unsampled grid point is a weighted average of values measured at $n$ nearby points:

$$ T(x,y) = 0 $$
<p>
$$z(x,y) = ∑ \lambda_j z(x_j,y_j) \; / ∑ \lambda_j \quad  j=1,..., n$$

<ul>
 <li class="fragment"> $\lambda_j = 1/d_j^p$ is weight proportional to power of inverse distance between 
      the measured point $(x_j,y_j)$ and unsampled point $(x,y)$, 
 <li class="fragment"> $p$ is exponent, usually $p=2$
 <li class="fragment">function passes through the data points
 <li class="fragment">smoothing can be introduced by setting the weights as  $\lambda_j = 1/ (d_j^p + \beta)$, 
     where $\beta$ is a smoothing parameter

triangles or polygons for non-linear interpolation

   <h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Instead of a universal solution that would automatically optimize its parameters 
 we now have a large number of different interpolation and approximation methods and their implementations and no robust automated approach for choosing the right one
<li class="fragment">Sound knowledge of interpolated phenomenon and the methods is needed to do it correctly
<li class="fragment">Given adequate amount of homogeneously distributed data, most methods will provide good results 
<li class="fragment">Keep interpolation in mind when collecting data (e.g. parallel far apart but densely sampled profiles are difficult to interpolate)
