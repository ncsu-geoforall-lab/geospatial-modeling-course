<p>
<ul>
<li>Numerical simulations: tools for gaining new knowledge - <b>virtual experiments</b>
<li class="fragment">Geospatial numerical simulations: the modeled quantities are function of a location on Earth
<p>
<li class="fragment">Geospatial models have evolved:
<ul>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">from: empirical, spatially averaged, static 
<p>
 <li class="fragment">to: process-based, spatially explicit and dynamic with 
     the aim to predict modeled quantity at any point in space and time

<section>
   <h3>Empirical models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">statistical models derived from experimental or observed data
 <li class="fragment">applicable only to landscapes under same conditions
 <li class="fragment">empirical / statistical methods often have physics based interpretations
 <li class="fragment">given sufficient data they can be very accurate (ML, AI)
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: Universal Soil Loss Equation - factors are based on observations,
but topographic LS factor also represents a special case of stream power </small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Process-based models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">derived from first principles, based on physical laws,
such as continuity and mass conservation equations
 <li class="fragment">refered to as mechanistic or deterministic models
 <li class="fragment">may include stochastic components
 <li class="fragment">can simulate the process under conditions not previously observed
 <li class="fragment">physics based equations often have empirical parameters
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: surface water flow model is based on St. Venant equation,
but uses empirical Mannings coefficient for computing flow velocity</small>

   <h3>Modeling components</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Modeled quantity:
     <b class="fragment">water depth [m], discharge [m$^3$/s], pollutant concentration[mg/l]</b>
  <li>Spatial and temporal scale:
     <b class="fragment">e.g. modeling a first order stream may require 1m spatial and 1 min temporal resolution</b>
  <li>Configuration space and interactions:
     <b class="fragment">water depth depends on precipitation, topography, soils, land use</b>
  <li>Governing equations:
     <b class="fragment"> continuity equations, diffusion, ... </b>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial representation</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Modeled quantities and environmental variables can be represented by continuous georeferenced fields
 <li>To support numerical simulations these fields need to be discretized:
<p>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially averaged units:</b> discrete polygons (hydrologic units, hillslope elements, landscape patches)
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially distributed representation:</b> structured and unstructured meshesi (grids), or random particles
  <li class="fragment">modeled quantities can also evolve along networks (streams, sewer networks) or represent discrete objects (particles, agents)</p>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially averaged models</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Spatially averaged models predict the modeled variable for each averaged unit, such as watershed,
the result is discrete polygons or a number
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Spatially distributed or spatially explicit models predict
the variable at any point in space and the result is continuous field

   <h3>Soil erosion modeling</h3>
<p>
Motivation: 
<ul>
<li class="fragment"> identification sediment sources and sinks 
<li class="fragment"> design of conservation measures
<li class="fragment">sustainable land use management
</ul>
</section>
-->

<section>
 <h3>Soil erosion modeling</h3>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">Modeled quantity: sediment transport rate [kg/(ms)], net erosion/deposition rate [kg/(m$^2$s)]
  <li class="fragment">Spatial and temporal scale: from hillslopes to watersheds, minutes (storms), annual rates
  <li class="fragment">Configuration space and interactions: sediment transport depends on water flow, topography, soil properties, land use
  <li class="fragment">Governing equations: continuity equation, diffusion, proliferation and decay
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Sediment transport equations</h3>
<p>
Assuming steady state flow, sediment transport by shallow water flow 
$q_s$ [kg/(ms)] can be approximated by sediment transport capacity $T_c$:
<p>
$$ q_s \approx T_c = K_T A^m (\sin \gamma)^n$$
<p>
<ul>
<li> where $A$ is contributing area as measure of water flow
<li>$K_T$ is transport capacity coefficient
<li>$\gamma$ is slope angle
<li>$m,n$ are empirical coefficients, control the relative influence of flow accumulation and slope
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Evolution of sediment transport</h3>
Water flow accumulates during rainfall, lower slope at foot of hillslopes reduces 
sediment transport capacity

<section>
   <h3>Net erosion and deposition</h3>
<p> <small>
Net erosion and deposition rate = 
change in sediment transport capacity $T_c$ in the direction of flow $\alpha$ =
divergence of the sediment transport vector field: 
</small>
<p>
$$d_s =\nabla\cdot {\bf q}_s  \approx {\partial (T_c  \cos \alpha ) \over {\partial x}} + {\partial (T_c  \sin \alpha ) \over {\partial y}}$$
<p><small>Equation is easy to compute using functions for partial derivatives and map algebra. Note that partial derivatives
 of a surface can also be computed using its slope $\beta$ and aspect $\alpha$ and keep in mind that instead of elevation our surface is the sediment
transport capacity field:
</small>
<p>
$$ {{\partial z} \over {\partial x}} = \tan \beta_s \cos \alpha_s $$
$$ {{\partial z} \over {\partial y}} = \tan \beta_s \sin \alpha_s $$
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Empirical equations</h3>
Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE, RUSLE)
$$E=R.K.L.S.C.P$$
where empirical factors/coefficients are:
<ul>
 <li>R - rainfall erosivity factor
 <li>K - soil erodibility factor
 <li>L - hillslope length or contributing area
 <li>S - slope steepness factor
 <li>C - cover-management factor
 <li>P - protection measures factor
</ul>
<p><small>
$L$ is a function of water flow over tilted plane, for complex topography 
we can replace it by $A$, upslope contributing area and modify RUSLE
to estimate sediment transport capacity and net erosion-deposition
as a change in sediment transport in the direction of flow.
