   <h3>Geospatial modeling of processes</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Numerical simulations: tools for gaining new knowledge - <b>virtual experiments</b>
<li class="fragment">Geospatial numerical simulations: the modeled quantities are function of a location on Earth
<p>
<li class="fragment">Geospatial models have evolved:
<ul>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">from: empirical, spatially averaged, static 
<p>
 <li class="fragment">to: process-based, spatially explicit and dynamic with 
     the aim to predict modeled quantity at any point in space and time
</ul>
 <li class="fragment">Most geospatial models combine empirical and process-based approaches
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Empirical models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">statistical models derived from experimental or observed data
 <li class="fragment">applicable only to landscapes under same conditions
 <li class="fragment">empirical / statistical methods often have physics based interpretations
 <li class="fragment">given sufficient data they can be very accurate (ML, AI)
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: Universal Soil Loss Equation - factors are based on observations,
but topographic LS factor also represents a special case of stream power </small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Process-based models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">derived from first principles, based on physical laws,
such as continuity and mass conservation equations
 <li class="fragment">refered to as mechanistic or deterministic models
 <li class="fragment">may include stochastic components
 <li class="fragment">can simulate the process under conditions not previously observed
 <li class="fragment">physics based equations often have empirical parameters
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: surface water flow model is based on St. Venant equation,
but uses empirical Mannings coefficient for computing flow velocity</small>

   <h3>Modeling components</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Modeled quantity:
     <b class="fragment">water depth [m], discharge [m$^3$/s], pollutant concentration[mg/l]</b>
  <li>Spatial and temporal scale:
     <b class="fragment">e.g. modeling a first order stream may require 1m spatial and 1 min temporal resolution</b>
  <li>Configuration space and interactions:
     <b class="fragment">water depth depends on precipitation, topography, soils, land use</b>
  <li>Governing equations:
     <b class="fragment"> continuity equations, diffusion, ... </b>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial representation</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Modeled quantities and environmental variables can be represented by continuous georeferenced fields
 <li>To support numerical simulations these fields need to be discretized:
<p>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially averaged units:</b> discrete polygons (hydrologic units, hillslope elements, landscape patches)
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially distributed representation:</b> structured and unstructured meshes, or random particles
  <li class="fragment">Modeled quantities can also evolve along networks (streams, sewer networks) or represent discrete objects (particles, agents)</p>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially averaged models</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Spatially averaged models predict the modeled variable for each averaged unit, such as watershed,
the result is discrete polygons or a number
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially distributed models</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spatially distributed or spatially explicit models predict
the variable at any point in space and the result is continuous field

   <h3>Geospatial modeling and GIS</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><b>workflow using standard GIS tools</b>: simple empirical models with physics based components
<li class="fragment"><b>models fully integrated as modules</b>: complex physics-based or empirical models
<li class="fragment"><b>models linked to GIS as extensions or add-ons</b>: common structure and interface
<li class="fragment"><b>complex modeling systems linked through data</b>: GIS is used for input data processing,
results analysis and visualization, but the model is independent from GIS.

   <h3>Empirical model: Rational equation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Simplest approximation of discharge from small watersheds
  <li>Assumes steady state, uniform rainfall excess and constant velocity
  <li>Discharge is then sum of rainfall excess produced by each grid cell routed to the outlet
</ul>

<p>
$$ Q = C \, i \, A $$
<p>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">$Q$ [$\rm m^3/s$] is maximum rate of runoff (discharge)
<p>
 <li class="fragment">$C$ is runoff coefficient
 (ratio of rainfall that becomes runoff : forest 0.05-0.25, pavement 0.75-0.95)
<p>
 <li class="fragment">$i$ [$\rm m/s$] average rainfall intensity
<p>
 <li class="fragment">$A$ [$\rm m^2$] is upslope contributing area
<p>
 <li class="fragment">to determine $i$ we need time to concentration 
(time water needs to flow along the longest flowpath to reach the outlet),
duration of rainfall needed to reach the steady state

   <h3>Soil erosion modeling</h3>
<p>
Motivation: 
<ul>
<li class="fragment"> identification sediment sources and sinks 
<li class="fragment"> design of conservation measures
<li class="fragment">sustainable land use management
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Modeled quantity: sediment transport rate [kg/(m s], net erosion/deposition rate [kg/(m$^2$ s)]
  <li>Spatial and temporal scale: from hillslopes to watersheds
  <li>Configuration space and interactions: sediment transport depends on water flow, topography, soil properties, land use
  <li>Governing equations: continuity equation, diffusion, proliferation and decay
</ul>
</section>

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Sediment transport equations</h3>
<p>
Assuming steady state flow, sediment transport $q_s$ can be approximated by
sediment transport capacity $T_c$:
<p>
$$ q_s \approx T_c = K_T A^m (\sin \gamma)^n$$
<p>
<small>
<ul>
<li> where $A$ is contributing area as measure of water flow
<li>$K_T$ is transport capacity coefficient
<li>$\gamma$ is slope angle
<li>$m,n$ are empirical coefficients
</ul>
</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Net erosion and deposition</h3>
<small>
Net erosion and deposition (source and sinks term) are computed as a change
in sediment transport capacity $T_c$ in the direction of flow (divergence of the sediment
transport vector field).
It is a dot product of a unit vector ${\bf s_0}$ in the direction of flow $\alpha$
<p>
$${\bf s_0} =(\cos \alpha, \sin \alpha)$$

<p>and sediment transport surface gradient
<p>

$$ {\bf q_s} = \left ( \frac{\partial T_c }{ \partial x}, \frac{\partial T_c }{ \partial y } \right ) $$

<p>leading to an equation that is easy to compute using map algebra
<p>
$$d_s =\nabla\cdot {\bf q}_s  \approx = {\partial (T_c  \cos \alpha ) \over {\partial x}} + {\partial (T_c  \sin \alpha ) \over {\partial y}}$$
