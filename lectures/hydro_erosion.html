    <h3>Learning objectives</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<!-- <li>empirical and physics based components of models-->
 <li>identify geospatial modeling of landscape processes
 <li>distinguish spatially averaged and distributed models
<!-- <li>steady state, continuous time and dynamic models -->
 <li>compare methods for spatial hydrologic modeling
 <li>apply modeling soil erosion, sediment transport and deposition
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial modeling of processes</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Numerical simulations: tools for gaining new knowledge - <b>virtual experiments</b>
<li class="fragment">Geospatial numerical simulations: the modeled quantities are function of a location on Earth
<p>
<li>Geospatial models have evolved:
<ul>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">from: empirical, spatially averaged, static 
<p>
 <li class="fragment">to: process-based, distributed (spatially explicit) and dynamic with 
     the aim to predict modeled quantity at any point in space and time
</ul>
 <li class="fragment">Most geospatial models combine both approaches
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Empirical models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">statistical models derived from experimental or observed data
 <li class="fragment">applicable only to landscapes under same conditions
 <li class="fragment">empirical / statistical methods often have physics based interpretations
 <li class="fragment">given sufficient data they can be very accurate (ML, AI)
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: Universal Soil Loss Equation - factors are based on observations,
but topographic LS factor also represents a special case of stream power </small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Process-based models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">derived from first principles, based on physical laws,
such as continuity and mass conservation equations
 <li class="fragment">refered to as mechanistic or deterministic models
 <li class="fragment">may include stochastic components
 <li class="fragment">can simulate the process under conditions not previously observed
 <li class="fragment">physics based equations often have empirical parameters
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: surface water flow model is based on St. Venant equation,
but uses empirical Mannings coefficient for computing flow velocity</small>

   <h3>Modeling components</h3>
When modeling landscape processes we need to consider:
<p>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Modeled quantity [units]:</b> water depth[m], discharge[m$^3$/s],
pollutant concentration[mg/l], vegetationi density[%cover], population density [p/area], ...
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Spatial and temporal scale:</b> e.g., first order strem [1m resolution, single storm, minutes]
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Configuration space and interactions:</b> modeled quantity as function of environmental variables, 
e.g., water depth depends on precipitation, infiltration, topography, land cover, ..
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Governing equations or rules:</b> continuity, mass preservation, diffusion, ...
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Modeling components</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Modeled quantity:
     <b class="fragment">water depth [m], discharge [m$^3$/s], pollutant concentration[mg/l]</b>
  <li>Spatial and temporal scale:
     <b class="fragment">e.g. first order stream [1m resolution], single storm [minutes]</b>
  <li>Configuration space and interactions:
     <b class="fragment">water depth depends on precipitation, topography, soil properties, land cover...</b>
  <li>Governing equations:
     <b class="fragment"> bivariate continuity equations, diffusion, ... </b>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial representation</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Modeled quantities and environmental variables can be represented by continuous georeferenced fields
 <li>To support numerical simulations these fields need to be discretized:
<ul>
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially averaged units:</b> discrete polygons (hydrologic units, hillslope elements, landscape patches)
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially distributed representation:</b> structured and unstructured meshes, or random particles
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Modeled quantities can also evolve along networks (streams, sewer networks) or represent discrete objects (particles, agents)</p>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially averaged models</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Spatially averaged models predict the modeled variable for each averaged unit, such as watershed,
the result is discrete polygons or a number
</ul>

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially distributed models</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spatially distributed or spatially explicit models predict
the variable at any point in space and the result is continuous field
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Coupled models for simulations of complex systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Continuous time simulations of coupled processes
<li class="fragment">problems: different spatial and temporal scales, discretization
<li class="fragment">examples: SWAT, WEPP: weather, runoff, infiltration, crop growth, soil erosion, pollutant transport
<li class="fragment">coupled agent based and continuous field models for complex human - nature systems simulations (MEDLANDS)
</ul>

   <h3>Geospatial modeling and GIS</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><b>workflow using standard GIS tools</b>: simple empirical models with physics based components
<li class="fragment"><b>models fully integrated as modules</b>: complex physics-based or empirical models
<li class="fragment"><b>models linked to GIS as extensions or add-ons</b>: common structure and interface
<li class="fragment"><b>complex modeling systems linked through data</b>: GIS is used for input data processing,
results analysis and visualization, but the model is independent from GIS.
<li class="fragment"><b>complex modeling systems can incorporate selected GIS capabilities</b>
</ul>

   <h3>Empirical model: Rational equation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Simplest approximation of discharge from small watersheds
  <li>Assumes steady state, uniform rainfall excess and constant velocity
  <li>Discharge is then sum of rainfall excess produced by each grid cell routed to the outlet
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Rational equation</h3>
<p>
$$ Q = C \, i \, A $$
<p>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">$Q$ [$\rm m^3/s$] is maximum rate of runoff (discharge)
<p>
 <li class="fragment">$C$ is runoff coefficient
 (ratio of rainfall that becomes runoff : forest 0.05-0.25, pavement 0.75-0.95)
<p>
 <li class="fragment">$i$ [$\rm m/s$] average rainfall intensity
<p>
 <li class="fragment">$A$ [$\rm m^2$] is upslope contributing area
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Time to concentration (time water needs to flow along the longest flowpath to reach the outlet)
is used to identify duration of rainfall needed to reach the steady state
