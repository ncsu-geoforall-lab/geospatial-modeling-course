<p>
<ul>
  <li>Spline interpolation 
  <li>Spline parameters: tension and smoothing

<section>
  <h3>Interpolation with radial basis functions</h3>
<p>Variational approach is based on minimizing:
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">deviations from the given points
  <li class="fragment">smoothness seminorm or roughness penalty
</ul>
<p class="fragment">
Physics-based interpretation:  spline interpolation function is a thin flexible plate with tunable bending energy
<p class="fragment">
Formally equivalent to universal kriging
<p class="fragment">
Radial basis functions: multiquadrics, splines
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Splines: general equation</h3>
<p>
$$
F(r) = T(r) + ∑ λ_j R(r,r_j)  \;    j=1,m
$$
<ul>
<li> $r = (x,y)$ is location of a grid point,
<li>$r_j=(x_j,y_j$) is location of a measured point
<li>$T(r)$ is trend (low order polynomial),
<li>$λ_j$ are coefficients
<li>$R(r,r_j)$ is a radial basis function
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Splines with different properties</h3>
  <p>Spline properties depend on the formulation of
smoothness seminorm or roughness penalty
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">thin plate spline
  <li class="fragment">spline with tension 
  <li class="fragment">regularized spline
  <li class="fragment">regularized spline with tension (completely regularized spline)
  <li class="fragment">see the smoothness seminorms in 
  <a href="http://fatra.cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial-modeling-course/resources/mitas_mitasova_1999_2005.pdf"> Table 1</a> 
  <li class="fragment">see the equations for selected $R(.)$ in the section 6.6.4

</ul>

   <h3>Regularized splines with tension (RST) </h3>
<p>
$$
F(r) = T(r) + ∑ λ_j R(\rho_j)  \;    j=1,m
$$
<ul>
<li>where $\rho =\varphi |r-r_j|$ 
<li>$\varphi$ is the tension parameter and 
<li>$|r-r_j|$ is the distance between the unsampled and measured points. 
</ul>
<p class="fragment">
Spline tension rescales distances, it has similar effect to shortening range in kriging 
or decreasing the distance weight exponent in IDW
<p class="fragment"><small>High tension stretches the distances making the sheet thinner and more flexible 
this shortens the range of influence of each point, so the range effect is inverse of tension</small> 
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spline: tension</h3>
Tension controls the stiffness of the plate:
<ul> 
 <li> high tension: soft rubber sheet, short range 
 <li> low tension: stiff steel plate, long range 
</ul>

<img height="230" src="img/spatial_interpolation/spline_ten10_1mn.jpg"> 
<p><small>
High tension, short  range of influence, soft rubber sheet, rough surface, peak or pit in each data point
<br>
Low tension, long range of influence, stiffer steel plate, smoother surface, possible overshoots.
<br>Note that tension is inverse of stiffness
</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spline: smoothing</h3>
<p> Allows the surface to deviate from measured points
<p>
$$F(x_i,y_i) = z(x_i, y_i) + \varepsilon(x_i,y_i)$$ 
<p>
<img height="280" src="img/spatial_interpolation/spline_smooth_springs.png"> 
<p>Reduces overshoots, noise, improves numerical stability
<br>Can be applied to individual points for data with different accuracies.
<p><small>Example: lidar bare earth data: low smoothing for open areas, high smoothing for forest</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spline: smoothing</h3>
<p>
Smoothing controls the deviation from the data points, large smoothing results in trend surface $T(x,y)$

   <h3>Spline: smoothing</h3>

   <h3>Spline interpolation from points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Spline with tension: numerical solution supports carved streams, but here the 
tension is too high
  <li>RST method lower tension combined with smoothing reduce bias towards given points
</ul>

   <h3>Spline interpolation from contours</h3>
If the density of points along contours is high, spline with high tension leads 
to sUrface with steps along contours, point reduction and lower tension improves the result

<section>
   <h3>Interpolation with anisotropy</h3>
Anisotropic tension is equivalent to rescaling of distances in a given direction: range of influence is different in the given direction, creating an anisotropic pattern in the resulting surface
<p>

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Interpolation from profiles</h3>
RTK GPS or single beam sonar use automated dense sampling along a line 
– anisotropy can be used to rescale distances between profiles and minimize artifacts
<p>

<p class="fragment" >Better alternative is to map it with a drone using structure from motion
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Interpolation accuracy</h3>
Effect of smoothing is measured by deviations 
$$
dz (x,y) = z' (x,y) – z (x,y)
$$
z' is the interpolated and z is the given value 

Predictive accuracy is measured by the  crossvalidation error

Artifacts, bias can be found using histograms, aspect maps, curvatures
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Trivariate Interpolation</h3>
Given $m$ points measured in 3D space, find such $F(x,y,z$) that for each $i=1,m$
$$
    w_i=F(x_i,y_i,z_i)              
$$
and compute $w_k=F(x_k,y_k,z_k)$ in 3D grid points
<p>
Similarly for 4D space – 3D + time: $w_i=F(x_i,y_i,z_i,t_i)$
<p class="fragment" >
Supported by specialized software for geostatistics: radial basis functions and splines. 
3D spline is available in GRASS GIS

   <h3>Trivariate Interpolation</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Interpolation of a 2D grid with influence of a third variable
 <li>Given $m$ points $(x_i,y_i,z_i,w_i)$  where $z_i = F_1 (x_i,y_i) 
find such $F_2(x,y,z)$ that for each $i=1,m$
$$
    w_i=F_2(x_i,y_i,z_i)
$$
and then compute $w_k=F_3(x_k,y_k)$ at $F_1 intersect F_2$
<p class="fragment" ><small>
Example: $w_i$ is precipitation measured at locations $x_i,y_i$ at near-ground elevation $z_i$.
F_1 is represented by a DEM, F_2 is an interpolated precipitation volume (voxel model) 
that passes through the points $(x_i,y_i,z_i,w_i)$. $F_3$ is a bivariate function represented
as a 2D precipitation grid which is an intersection of a DEM and the interpolated precipitation volume F_2
</small>
<p class="fragment" ><small>Statistical approach of the method is given by Hutchinson
and has been used to interpolate global climate maps (add ref and verify)</small>
