</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative flow parameters</h3>
<p>Flow routing over a DEM is used to derive the following parameters and features:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li class="fragment">flow path length 
  <li class="fragment">flow accumulation
  <li class="fragment">stream networks 
  <li class="fragment">contributing areas

   <h3>Computing flow direction</h3>
<p class="fragment">What is flow direction:
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">direction of surface gradient vector $\nabla z = (f_x, f_y)$
 <li class="fragment">steepest slope direction
 <li class="fragment">aspect (orientation of hillslope)
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Methods to derive flow direction from a DEM:
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">discrete: D8, D16

<section>
   <h3>Discrete flow direction</h3>
<p>
D8 algorithm

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Continuous flow direction</h3>
<p>
D-infinity algorithm: gradient direction is derived from a continuous function (polynomial or spline)
$$\alpha^\circ = {\arccos} \left( -f_y / \sqrt{f_x^2+f_y^2} \right) = \arctan (f_y / f_x)  $$

   <h3>Flow routing</h3>
Tracing flow in the gradient direction to compute 
<p>
<ul>
