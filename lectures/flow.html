    <h2>Learning objectives</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>cumulative terrain parameters based on flow tracing: definitions and general approach 
(flow path length, flow accumulation, stream networks, watershed boundaries, ridge lines)
  <li>methods for computing flow direction (D8, Dinf), flow tracing (SFD, MFD, uniform, weighted)
  <li>methods for flow tracing through depressions and flat areas (filling, carving, hybrid, least cost path)
  <li>principle of stream extraction from a DEM 
  <li>watershed delineation

   <h3>Cumulative flow parameters</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li>flow path length, 
  <li>flow accumulation
  <li>stream networks 
  <li>contributing areas, watershed boundaries
  <li>ridge lines
  </ul>
<p>Flow tracing over DEM is used to derive these parameters

   <h3>Computing flow direction</h3>
What is flow direction:
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">direction of gradient vector
 <li class="fragment">aspect (orientation of hillslope)
</ul>
<p>How to derive flow direction from a DEM?
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">D8, D16 (discrete)
 <li class="fragment">D-infinity (continuous)
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Discrete flow direction</h3>
D8 algorithm: 
<ul>
<li>8 directions: aspect discretized to 0, 45, 90, ... degrees
<li>estimated from elevation differences between the given grid cell and its 8 neighboring cells
<li>flow direction is in the direction of meximum elevation difference
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Continuous flow direction</h3>
D-infinity algorithm
<ul>
  <li>aspect derived from a continuous function (polynomial or spline)
  <li>linear interpolation of aspect along the grid cell edges to trace flowlines
</ul>

   <h3>Flow routing</h3>
Tracing flow in the gradient direction to compute 
<ul>
 <li>flowlines
 <li>flow path length 
 <li>flow accumulation
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Flow lines</h3>
<p>
<ul>
   <li>Lines along the steepest slope - in the direction of gradient
   <li>Perpendicular to contours
  <li>D8 flowlines - along grid lines and diagonals
  <li>Dinf:linear interpolation of aspect along the grid cell edges to trace flowlines
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Flow path length</h3>
<p>Definition and applications
<ul>
  <li>length of the flow line from the given cell to the outlet used to compute time to concentration (steady state flow)

  <li>hillslope length - from the given cell to a  flat or depression, used for erosion modeling using Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) - measure of steady state flow depth for a  uniform hillslope
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Flow path length</h3>
<p>how far is the given cell from the outlet
<p>what is the length of a hillslope above a given cell

<section>
   <h3>Flow accumulation</h3>
<ul>
 <li>number of cells draining into a given cell = number of flow lines passing through each cell
 <li>size of the upslope contributing area (horizontal, in cell units)
 <li>measure of steady state flow depth
</ul>
