   <h3>Flow routing methods</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Single Flow Direction (SFD)</strong> moves entire unit of flow into a single downslope cell: 
does not capture flow dispersal on hillslopes with convex tangential curvature
  <li><strong>Multiple flow direction (MFD)</strong> partitions flow into two or more downslope directions 
  <li>both can be implemented with D8 or Dinf

   <h3>Weighted flow routing</h3>
Each cell is assigned weight proportional to the amount of runoff it produces 
(rainfall excess available for runoff after infiltration and vegetation intercept)

   <h3>Stream extraction</h3>
<ul>
 <li>automated stream mapping: extracting connected stream network from flow accumulation map
 <li>Stream raster map is derived using map algebra using flow accumulation threshold
 <li>Result is converted to vector representation, build connected stream network
 <li>Stream origin is dynamic, often driven by groundwater: additional information is needed,
 machine learning can be used
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>Flow routing in flat areas</h3>
<ul>
 <li>to create connected stream network flow needs to be routed through flats and depressions
 <li class="fragment">integer DEMs, lakes or filled depressions create flat areas 
 <li class="fragment">flat areas: zero slope and undefined aspect
 <li class="fragment">solutions: 
 <ul>
 <li class="fragment">iterative assignment of direction from the first draining cell
 <li class="fragment">imposed gradient (small change in elevation)
 </ul>
</ul>

   <h3>Hydrologically conditioned DEM</h3>
<p>
Modified DEM with connected stream network where each grid cell drains into the outlet
<ul>
  <li>hydrologically conditioned DEM does not have depressions or flat areas
  <li>it should not be referred to as hydrologically correct, because - all wetlands are removed
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Stream extraction accuracy</h3>
<p>
Measured as horizontal accuracy of stream centerline
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">topographic maps (blue lines) - have often the lowest accuracy, old
 <li class="fragment">National Hydrographic Data - updated, structured representation of stream and river networks
 <li class="fragment">extracted from lidar-based DEMs - better, but accuracy low in coastal plane, improved new lidar mapping
 <li class="fragment">digitized from high resolution orthophotos and on ground surveys - most accurate except forested areas
 <li class="fragment">structures require additional information (bridges are represented as dams in DEMs)
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Watersheds</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>watershed - important land management unit
 <li>water and mass from a watershed drains to a single point: outlet
 <li>other terms for watershed: (drainage) basin, catchment, contributing area
 <li>watersheds can be organized into hierarchies based on the size of contributing area
</ul>
