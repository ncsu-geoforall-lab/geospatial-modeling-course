   <h3>Geospatial data acquisition</h3>
<p>Current revolution in mapping technologies: 
<br>continuous data collection anywhere by anyone
<p class=small>Have you ever collected geospatial data?
<br> If yes - share with us where and how
<br> DE post answers on moodle discussion
<p> Image composite - collecting geodata
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial data acquisition</h3>
<p>
Professional mapping technologies
<p>
<ul>
 <li>passive and active aerial and satellite sensors
 <li>on-ground surveys : (RTK)GPS, total station, lidar
 <li>in situ thematic data sensors: e.g., air quality, river stages, water quality, soil moisture; 
</ul>
<p>
Image composite - professional mapping
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial data acquisition</h3>
<p>
Non-traditional data sources and technologies: examples
<p>
<ul>
 <li>digital cameras, webcams
 <li>smartphones
 <li>citizen sUAS
 <li>mobile sensor networks : cars
</ul>

   <h3>From mapping to GIS</h3>
<p>
Acquired data are transformed into georeferenced, 
discrete representations of landscape features 
<p>
<ul>
<li>georeferencing (often in real-time using GPS)
<li>feature or theme extraction (e.g. image classification)
<li>building GIS data model representation <br>(geometry, attributes, time)
</ul>
<p> Image composite - diagram?
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Georeferencing</h3>
<p>
Georeferenced data: location on Earth is represented in a Coordinate Referenced System  
<p>
<ul>
<li>geographic coordinate system: (spherical CRS?)
<br>geoid -- ellipsoid -- latitude/longitude
<li>projected reference systems (there are many):
<br>geoid -- ellipsoid -- developable surface -- plane -- x,y 
</ul>

<section>
   <h3>National and state CRS</h3>
<p>
CRS is defined by (VERIFY and update) 
<ul>
<li>Reference spheroid/geoid and datum: <br> e.g. GRS80-NAD83, WGS84
<li>Vertical datum: e.g. NAVD88 <font class=credit> North american Vertical Datum 1988</font>
<li>Projection: e.g. 
  <ul>
  <li>Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC): states in US
  <li>Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM): USGS, military
  <li>Albers Equal Area (conic): USGS national map 
  </ul>
</ul>

   <h3>Popular Visualization CRS</h3> 
<p>
Most common in on-line mapping systems
<p>Spherical Mercator projection: <br>cylindrical on sphere, large distortions
<p>
EPSG statement
<p class=small>We have reviewed the coordinate reference system used by Google, etc.
and believe that it is technically flawed. We will not devalue the EPSG dataset by 
including such inappropriate geodesy and cartography.”
<br>
In 1989, North American professional geographic organizations  
called for a ban on all rectangular coordinate maps (especially Mercator).

   <h3>Popular Visualization CRS</h3>
<p>
The reference system was eventually included (EPSG code 3785) 
- it is not recommended for professional work

   <h3>Coordinate transformations</h3>
<p>
Geospatial data often come in different CRS, e.g.:
<ul>
  <li>Federal agencies: Geographic coordinates, Albers equal area, UTM
 <li>State agencies: State Plane CRS
 <li>Older data may have different datums (NAD27, NAD83)
</ul>
<p>
Coordinate transformations
<p>
<b>x,y -> longitude, latitude -> x’,y’</b> 
<p class=small>
often performed on-fly, may be inaccurate and time consuming
<br>for projects with high accuracy requirements: first reproject all data into a suitable
common CRS, then perform analysis and modeling
</p>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial data models</h3>
<p>
Mapped, georeferenced data are transformed into discrete GIS representations using
<ul>
  <li>raster (regular grid) or,
  <li>vector (feature: point, line, area/polygon) 
</ul>
<p>geospatial data models
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial data models</h3>
<p>
Two different types of objects/phenomena
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>continuous fields: w=f(x,y), w=f(x,y,z)</b>
  <ul>
  <li>each point in space is assigned a distinct value, 
      change between two neighboring points is relatively small: elevation, precipitation
  <li>represented by raster data model, 
  <li>vector model is also used: meshes, TIN, isolines or points. 
  </ul>
<li><b>discrete objects/features: lines, points or areas with attributes</b>
  <ul>
  <li>represented by vector data model as geometry(shape) with attribute table or object based (geodatabase); 
  <li>raster representation is also used : roads, streams, census blocks, land use, schools
  </ul>
</ul>
</section>

   <h3>Raster data model 2D</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>header + matrix of values (INT, FP, DP)
  <li>continuous field : value assigned to a grid point
  <li>discrete object : cat value assigned to pixel (area)
  <li>imagery - several bands
  <li>spatial extent and resolution
<p>Image elevations, speed limit

   <h3>Raster data model for volumes</h3>
<p>
<ul>

 <li>combined representation: 
 <ul>
  <li>continuous (horizontally) 
  <li>discrete (vertically)
 </ul> 
<p>Image animation soil layers
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Raster data model for volumes</h3>
<p>
3D raster - voxel model
<ul>
  <li>header + 3D matrix of values 
  <li>vertical resolution is usually much finer than horizontal
  <li>mostly used for 3D continuous representation w=f(x,y,z)
</ul>

  <li>topology: nodes, vertices, centroids, line, polyline, boundary, polygon
  </ul>
 <li>attributes:
 <ul>
 <li> points, lines and areas are abstract representations 
      of complex features (firestation – point, road – centerline, ...)
 <li>attributes of these features are stored in data management systems
 </ul>
</ul>
