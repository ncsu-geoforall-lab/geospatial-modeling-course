NHDSstreams are generalized - they have simplified geometry, leading to shorter length

   <li class="fragment">resolution should be sufficiently higher (cell size should be n-times smaller) than distances  (buffer widths)

   <h3>Cost surfaces</h3>
Cumulative (accumulated) cost surface: 
<ul>
<li class="fragment">raster representation of cumulative cost 
of reaching the target point(s) from any location in the given region.
</ul>

Input cost map 
<ul>
<li class="fragment">value assigned to a cell represents cost of traversing that cell, 
<li class="fragment">cost can be based on time, energy, etc.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative cost surface to a point</h3>
Proximity surface representing
shortest path (distance) from each cell to the target point if cost for each cell is 1:

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative cost surface</h3>
To measure the proximity (distance), traverse the region in:
standard 8 directions, 
Knight 16 directions
<p> <img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/cost1D8.jpg">
<img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/cost1D816.jpg">
<p><small>cost for each cell is 1</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cost map</h3>
If cost is spatially variable, we need to define cost to traverse each grid cell,
usually expressed as time $t[s]$ derived from:
<ul>
    <li class="fragment">inverse of speed limit (or average speed data) for driving,                          
    <li class="fragment">slope and vegetation density for walking on trails 
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>
Example: cost surface derived as minimum time $t[s]$ needed to traverse a grid cell with resolution d[m]
$$ t = d / v $$
where, v is speed (e..g speed limit stored in roads/streets data layer.
Cost map is computed using map algebra.</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cost map</h3>
Deriving a cost map from speed limit, as time to traverse a 30m cell [seconds]

off-road cells are assigned to 5 mi/hr, for realistic travel time per cell
speed limit [mi/hr
time to traverse a 30m cell [seconds]
Cost can be defined par grid cell or per map unit, depending on implementation

   <h3>Cumulative cost surface</h3>
Cumulative cost surface: time to reach the point A, 
the higher the hill the more time it takes to reach A
