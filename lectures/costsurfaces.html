   <h3>Cost surfaces</h3>
<p>
Cumulative (accumulated) cost surface measures proximity based on cost: 
<ul>
<li class="fragment">raster representation of cumulative cost 
of reaching the target point(s) from any location in the given region.
</ul>

<p class="fragment">
Input cost map 
<ul>
<li class="fragment">value assigned to a cell represents cost of traversing that cell, 
<li class="fragment">cost can be based on time, energy, price, etc.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative cost surface to a point</h3>
Proximity surface represents
shortest path (distance) from each cell to the target point if cost for each cell is 1
<p> <img height="380" src="img/analysis_costsurf/costsurf_dist.jpg">
<p><small>Derive continuous buffer as a subset with distance less than given threshold</small>

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative cost surface</h3>
To measure the proximity (distance), traverse the region in:
standard 8 directions, 
Knight 16 directions
<p> <img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/cost1D8.jpg">
<img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/cost1D16.jpg">
<p><small>cost for each cell is 1</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cost map</h3>
If cost is spatially variable, we need to define cost to traverse each grid cell,
usually expressed as time $t[s]$ derived, for example, from:
<p>
<ul>
    <li class="fragment">speed data for driving,                       
    <li class="fragment">velocity estimates for flows,                       
    <li class="fragment">slope, vegetation and obstacles for walking on trails 
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>
Example: cost map derived as time $t[s]$ needed to traverse a $d[m]$ resolution grid cell
$$ t = d / v $$
where, $v$ [m/s] is speed, approximated e.g., by speed limit stored in roads/streets data layer.
Cost map is computed using arithmetic expression in map algebra.</small>
</section>

   <h3>Least cost path</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">using the cumulative cost surface, find the least cost (fastest) path to the target point
<li class="fragment">least cost path follows the oposite directions used for creating the cumulative 
cost surface: back-links 
 <li class="fragment">similar to steepest slope line used for flow routing with terrain replaced by cost surface

  <li class="fragment">$\Delta s$ [m]: distance across a grid cell
  <li class="fragment">$\Delta h_u, \Delta h_{md}, \Delta h_{sd}$ [m] - elevation difference upslope, moderate downslope and steep downslope
  <li class="fragment">$w.f$ [s]: added time needed to traverse a cell due to friction, $f$ is a friction map, $w$ is weight
  <li class="fragment">walking upslope and steep downslope increase cost, moderate downslope decreases cost.
