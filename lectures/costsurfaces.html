   <h3>Cost surfaces</h3>
<p>
Cumulative (accumulated) cost surface measures proximity based on cost: 
<ul>
<li class="fragment">raster representation of cumulative cost 
of reaching the target point(s) from any location in the given region.
</ul>

<p>
Input cost map 
<ul>
<li class="fragment">value assigned to a cell represents cost of traversing that cell, 
<li class="fragment">cost can be based on time, energy, etc.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative cost surface to a point</h3>
Proximity surface represents
shortest path (distance) from each cell to the target point if cost for each cell is 1
<p> <img height="380" src="img/analysis_costsurf/costsurf_dist.jpg">
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative cost surface</h3>
To measure the proximity (distance), traverse the region in:
standard 8 directions, 
Knight 16 directions
<p> <img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/cost1D8.jpg">
<img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/cost1D16.jpg">
<p><small>cost for each cell is 1</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cost map</h3>
If cost is spatially variable, we need to define cost to traverse each grid cell,
usually expressed as time $t[s]$ derived, for example, from:
<ul>
    <li class="fragment">speed data for driving,                          
    <li class="fragment">slope, vegetation density and obstacles for walking on trails 
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>
Example: cost surface derived as time $t[s]$ needed to traverse a $d[m]$ resolution grid cell
$$ t = d / v $$
where, $v$ is speed, approximated e.g., by speed limit stored in roads/streets data layer.
Cost map is computed using arithmetic expression in map algebra.</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cost map</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Speed limit and cost raster maps.
 <li>Cost is time [sec] to traverse a 30m cell, off-road cells are assigned 5 mi/hr.
</ul>
<p> <img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/speed_rast.png">
<img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/cost_rast.png">
<p style="small">Cost can be defined per grid cell or per map unit, depending on implementation</p>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative cost surface</h3>
Cumulative cost surface represents the time to reach the target point A from anywhere in the region.
<p> <img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/costsurface_3d.png">
<p><small>The higher the hill the more time it takes to reach A, highways are valleys</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Least cost path</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">using the cumulative cost surface, find the least cost (fastest) path to the target point
<li class="fragment">least cost path follows the oposite directions used for creating the cumulative 
cost surface: back-links 
 <li class="fragment">similar to steepest slope line used for flow routing with terrain replaced by cost surface
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Least cost path: back-link raster</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">direction of least cost path to the target from all grid cells = backlink map
<li class="fragment">equivalent to surface gradient direction (aspect) map 
</ul>

  <li class="fragment">find safe access routs during natural disaters (earthquakes, floods)
  <li class="fragment">estimate time for watewater to get to treatment plant from any point in sewershed
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Least cost path applications</h3>
Locate the firestation that can reach the accident site $A$ on the highway the fastest and identify the shortest path:
<ul>
   <li class="fragment">use query to extract cumulative cost (travel time) to A from all firestations, add the time
to the attribute table
   <li class="fragment">identify the firestation $F_1$ with the lowest cost
   <li class="fragment">trace the least cost path from $F_1$ to $A$

   <h3>Cost surface for walking</h3>
Empirical equation to estimate time $t[s]$ to traverse a grid cell walking in complex terrain:
<p>
$$
t = a\Delta s + b \Delta h_u + c \Delta h_{md} + d \Delta h_{sd} + w.f
$$
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">$a,b,c,d$ [s/m]: weights, functions of inverse speed $1/v$
  <li class="fragment">$\Delta s$ [m]: distance across a grid cell
  <li class="fragment">$\Delta h_u, \Delta h_{md}, \Delta h_{sd}$ [m] - elevation difference upslope, moderate downslope and steep downslope
  <li class="fragment">$w.f$ [s]: added time needed to traverse a cell due to friction, $f$ is a friction map, $w$ is weight
  <li class="fragment">walking upslope and steep downslope increase cost, moderate downslope decreases cost.
  <li class="fragment">default values for $a,b,c,d$ are empirical coefficients, based on man walking effort at standard conditions.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Input data for estimating cost</h3>
Walking cost combines inputs derived from elevation $\Delta h_u, \Delta h_{md}, \Delta h_{sd}$
 and land cover is used for the friction map $f$.
