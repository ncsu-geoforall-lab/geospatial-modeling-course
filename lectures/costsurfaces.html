   <h3>Cost surfaces</h3>
<p>
Cumulative (accumulated) cost surface: 
<ul>
<li class="fragment">raster representation of cumulative cost 
of reaching the target point(s) from any location in the given region.
</ul>

<p>
Input cost map 
<ul>
<li class="fragment">value assigned to a cell represents cost of traversing that cell, 
<li class="fragment">cost can be based on time, energy, etc.
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative cost surface to a point</h3>
Proximity surface represents
shortest path (distance) from each cell to the target point if cost for each cell is 1
<p> <img height="380" src="img/analysis_costsurf/costsurf_dist.jpg">
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative cost surface</h3>
To measure the proximity (distance), traverse the region in:
standard 8 directions, 
Knight 16 directions
<p> <img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/cost1D8.jpg">
<img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/cost1D16.jpg">
<p><small>cost for each cell is 1</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cost map</h3>
If cost is spatially variable, we need to define cost to traverse each grid cell,
usually expressed as time $t[s]$ derived, for example, from:
<ul>
    <li class="fragment"> speed data for driving,                          
    <li class="fragment">slope and vegetation density for walking on trails 
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>
Example: cost surface derived as time $t[s]$ needed to traverse a $d[m]$ resolution grid cell
$$ t = d / v $$
where, $v$ is speed, approximated e.g., by speed limit stored in roads/streets data layer.
Cost map is computed using arithmetic expression in map algebra.</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Cost map</h3>
Speed limit and cost raster maps.
Cost is time [sec] to traverse a 30m cell, off-road cells are assigned 5 mi/hr.
Cost can be defined per grid cell or per map unit, depending on implementation

<section>
   <h3>Cumulative cost surface</h3>
Cumulative cost surface: time to reach the point A from anywhere in the region.
Example application: locate the firestation that can reach the accident the fastest and identify the shortest path
<p> <img height="350" src="img/analysis_costsurf/costsurface_3d.png">
<small>The higher the hill the more time it takes to reach A, highways are valleys</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Least cost path</h3>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">using the cumulative cost surface, find the least cost (fastest) path to the target point
<li class="fragment">least cost path (LCP) follows the steepest slope line, equivalent to flow routing with terrain replaced by cost surface
<li class="fragment">depending on algorithm used for flow routing depressions or flats in cost surface may lead to wrong results
<li class="fragment">save the directions used for creating the cumulative cost surface as back-link  and compute LCP as tracked path
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Least cost path applications</h3>
find foredune ridge, firefighters escape routes
