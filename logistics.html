                <a href="https://vcl.ncsu.edu/">NCSU VCL</a>
                OSGeo Live and ArcGIS Desktop/Pro environments (both contain also QGIS).
                The recommended image for the class is ArcGIS Pro 2.2,
                although it contains a slightly outdated version of GRASS GIS.

   <li>See more at <a href="https://grassbook.org/datasets/datasets-3rd-edition/">GRASSbook datasets description</a></li>
</ul>
-->
<p>
Download:
<ul>
<li>Sample GRASS GIS dataset:
    <ul>
        <li>Start GRASS GIS. In the data management window,
            click the icon <em>Download sample location to current database</em> and
            select <em>Complete NC location</em>, click <em>Download</em>,
            close when finished. You should see a location <em>nc_spm_08_grass7</em> in your database.
            See also

<!-- add link to slides with screenshots and/or video - THIS MAY BE HARD TO DO WITHOUT VIDEO! -->
        <li>If using GRASS GIS version &lt 8.0:
           Create a <em>grassdata</em> directory, e.g. C:\Users\myname\Documents\grassdata. 
           Start GRASS GIS. In the <em>Startup</em> window, under the <em>Location</em> section, 
           press <em>Download</em>, select <em>Complete NC location</em>, press <em>Download</em>, close when finished.

        <li>Alternatively, you can download and unzip <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/sampledata/north_carolina/nc_spm_08_grass7.zip">
            <em>nc_spm_08_grass7</em></a> into the <em>grassdata</em> directory and then start GRASS GIS - you should see the dataset
            in the Data catalog. 
            In this case it is <strong>important</strong> to make sure that your unziping software does
            not create additional directory with the same name, e.g. on MS Windows make sure that you do not get 
            <em>nc_spm_08_grass7\nc_spm_08_grass7</em>.
        <li>
            The same dataset is provided during installation of GRASS GIS
            on MS Windows under the name North_Carolina.

Instructions:
<ul>
    <li>Create folders for your GIS data in a directory where you have permissions to write, for example:

            <li>Mac OS or Linux: ideally in your home directory, e.g. /home/myname/Documents/grassdata</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>After downloading, unpack ArcGIS geodatabase into arcdata folder and, if using GRASS GIS version &lt 8, 
    copy GRASS GIS location into grassdata folder</li>
    <li><strong>Important:</strong> make sure that your unziping software does
    not create additional directory with the same name, e.g. on MS Windows make sure that you do not get nc_spm_08_grass7\nc_spm_08_grass7.

<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>

In the assignments you will be performing similar geospatial analyses
in two different software packages - GRASS GIS and ArcGIS Pro.
<em>Both</em> GRASS GIS and ArcGIS Pro solutions are required,
described in a single paper (more details see below).
Step-by-step instructions are provided, but it is your task to explain
what is being done in terms of methods and results,
based on the lectures, manual pages and other on-line resources.

<h4>Report</h4>
<ul>
    <li>For each topic (as indicated in the schedule) you will submit a brief paper
    with min. 800 word text and 2 or more pages of graphics</li>
    <li>Required paper sections:
        <ol>
            <li>Introduction: task, problem, background, importance, motivation</li>
            <li>Methods: general description of methods and concepts, do not repeat instructions
              and do not discuss software issues here - this section should be software independent, common for
              both ArcGIS and GRASS GIS and equations for methods should be included where appropriate.
              In this section you should demonstrate that for the given step-by-step instructions
              your were able to explain what methods are being used to solve the given problem</li>
              <li>Results: images, maps, graphs, tables with comments, focus on what is interesting in the data
                  and the derived maps, how does the method used influence the results.
                  Include answers to questions in this section.</li>
              <li>Discussion: was there anything unexpected or problematic in the results?
                          Were there any issues related to the methdology? Also discuss the software issues,
                          including fixes and suggestions for improvements here.</li>
              <li>Conclusion: 1-2 sentences what you have learned</li>
