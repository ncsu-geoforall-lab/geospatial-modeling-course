<h2>Working with data in different coordinate systems</h2>

GRASS GIS Location can contain data only in one projection. This is for consistency.


<h3>Importing data in common vector and raster formats</h3>

<p>
If your data are in two different projections,
you create the location with one dataset
(in location wizard get projection from a referenced file).
Then you can use r.import and v.import modules to import the data.

<p>
If the coordinates in fact match the coordinates you want but the projection
information is wrong, then it is appropriate to use r.in.gdal
with the -o flag to overwrite the projection check and import
the data as they are (same also for the GUI import dialog).
In GUI dialog the flag -o is not mentioned, "override projection check"
is the right thing to use.

<p>
If you zoom to raster or vector in GRASS GUI and it does not fit with
the rest of the data, it means that it was imported with wrong projection
information (or with overwriting the checks when the coordinates in fact don't match).
You can use r.info and v.info to get the information
about the extents of (already imported) rasters and vectors.

<p>
If you don't have the right Location, you should know
which coordinate system/projection you want to use.
In which projection your vector points are?
Ideally, you should know EPSG code, creating location using EPSG code is simple.

<p>
If you mean data in other GRASS Locations, use r.proj and v.proj in the desired Location to reproject from the other Location.


<h3>Importing CSV and other ASCII data</h3>

<p>
There are many formats of plain text files. In context of GIS we usually
talk about ASCII formats and CSV files. CSV files usually hold only
coordinates and sometimes attributes of points.

<p>
These files usually don't have projection information attached to them,
so we must be very careful and import the date only if the coordinates
are in the projection of the Location we are using.

<p>
Let's create a CSV file called <code>points.txt</code>
using a text editor (Notepad++, TextEdit, MS Notepad), for example:

<pre>
637803.6,223804.7
641835.5,223761.2
643056.0,217419.0
</pre>

The coordinates we entered are in EPSG:3358 and we assume that the
GRASS Location is using this projection as well.
This file can be imported to GRASS GIS using:

<pre><code>
v.in.ascii input=points.txt output=test_ascii separator=comma x=1 y=2
</code></pre>


<h3>Importing lidar point clouds</h3>

Lidar point clouds can be imported in two ways: as raster maps using binning
or as vector points. However first of all, one must explore the dataset.

<p>
In command line, we can check the projection information and other metadata
about a LAS file using <em>lasinfo</em> tool:

<pre><code>
lasinfo tile_0793_016_spm.las
</code></pre>

<em>lasinfo</em> tool is included in most GRASS GIS distributions but sometimes,
a special package is need, often called <em>liblas-bin</em> in package managers.

<p>
<em class="module">r.in.lidar</em> module can be used to scan the spatial extent
of the dataset:

<pre><code>
r.in.lidar input=tile_0793_016_spm.las -s
</code></pre>


<h4>Binning</h4>

Before creating the actual raster with elevation, we need to decide the extent
and the resolution we will use for the binning. We can use
<em class="module">r.in.lidar</em> module for that when setting the resolution
directly and using a flag to use dataset extent instead of taking it from
the computational region.
We are interested in the density of points, so we use <code>method=n</code>:

<pre><code>
r.in.lidar input=tile_0793_016_spm.las output=tile_0793_016_n method=n -e resolution=2
</code></pre>

After determining the optimal resolution for binning and the desired area,
we can use <em class="module">g.region</em> to set the computational region.
<em class="module">r.in.lidar</em> without the additional parameters above
will create a raster map from points using binning with resolution and extent
taken from the computational region:

<pre><code>
r.in.lidar input=tile_0793_016_spm.las output=tile_0793_016
</code></pre>


<h4>Interpolation</h4>

When the result of binning contains a lot of NULL cells or when it is not
smooth enough for further analysis, we can import the point cloud as vector
points and interpolate a raster.

<p>
Supposing that we already determined the desired extent and resolution
(using <em class="module">r.in.lidar</em>) we can use 

<pre><code>
v.in.lidar input=tile_0793_016_spm.las output=tile_0793_016 -r -t -b
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
v.surf.rst input=tile_0793_016 elevation=tile_0793_016_elevation slope=tile_0793_016_slope aspect=tile_0793_016_aspect npmin=100 tension=20 smooth=1
</code></pre>


<h4>Importing data in different projection</h4>

In case that the projection of the file doesn't match the projection
used in the GRASS Location, reprojection can be done before import
using <em>las2las</em> tool.

<p>
The following example command is for reprojecting tiles
in NAD83/North Carolina in feet (EPSG:2264)
into NAD83/North Carolina in meters (EPSG:3358):
<pre><code>
las2las --a_srs=EPSG:2264 --t_srs=EPSG:3358 -i input_spf.las -o output_spm.las
</code></pre>

<em>las2las</em> tool is included in most GRASS GIS distributions but sometimes,
a special package is need, often called <em>liblas-bin</em> in package managers.


<h4>Importing data with broken projection information</h4>

In case that the specified projection of the file doesn't match the projection
used in the GRASS Location, but the actual coordinates are in the projection
used in the GRASS Location, we can use <code>-o</code> flag to skip the projection
check and import the data as they are. Here we scan the file to get the extent:

<pre><code>
r.in.lidar input=tile_0793_016_spm.las -s -o
</code></pre>


<h3>Transferring GRASS GIS data between two computers</h3>

If two GRASS GIS users want to exchange data, they can use GRASS GIS native
exchange format &ndash; <em>packed map</em>. A vector or raster map can be
exported from a GRASS Location in this format using
<em class="module">v.pack</em> or <em class="module">r.pack</em> respectively.
This format preserves everything for a map in a way as it is stored in
a GRASS Database. Projection of the source and target GRASS Locations
must be the same.

<p>
If GRASS GIS users wish to exchange GRASS Mapsets, they can do so as long as
the source and target GRASS Locations have the same projection.
The PERMANENT Mapset should not be usually exchanged as it is a crucial part
of the given Location.
Locations can be easily transfered in between GRASS Database directories
on different computers as they carry all data and projection information
within them and the storage format used in the background is platform independent.
Locations as well as whole GRASS Databases can be copied and moved
in the same way as any other directories on the computer.
