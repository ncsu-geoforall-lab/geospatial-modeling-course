<h3>Interpolation using splines</h3>
Interpolate elevation surfaces from spot point heights using the Spline tool 
in the Spatial Analyst toolbox.<br>
Use three different weights (0.1, 1, 1000) to control the tension, and thus, the resulting surface character.<br>
For the first interpolation, you'll leave the Weight field blank, accepting the default 0.1 value.<br>
In subsequent interpolations, you'll enter the explicit weights.

<pre>
ArcMap File->Add Data->Add Data...
Select ncshape.mdb/elev_lid792_randpts
Check out a Spatial Analyst Extension license
Open the ArcToolbox
Select 'Spatial Analyst Tools->Interpolation->Spline'
Set 'Input Point Features' to 'elev_lid792_randpts'
Set 'Z value field' to 'value_'
Set 'Output Raster' to '.\Interpolation2\elev_tps'
Set 'Output cell size' to '2'
Set to Spline Type to 'TENSION'
Leave the other inputs as defaults     
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Evaluate impact of interpolation function paramaters on the resulting surface
using hillshade.
<p>
Check out a 3D Analyst Extension license.<br>
Set the default output raster cell size environment variable to 2.

<pre>
Geoprocessing->Environments...->Raster Analysis->Cell Size
Set 'As Specified Below' and enter 2 in the field that follows.
Click 'OK'
Open the ArcToolbox (if it's not already open)
Select '3D Analyst Tools -> Raster Surface -> Hillshade'
Set 'Input Surface' to 'elev_tps'
Set 'Output Raster' to '.\Interpolation2\Hillsh_tps'
Leave the other inputs as defaults
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Repeat the spline interpolations above, using weights of 1 and then 1000,<br>
and generate the associated hill shade surfaces.<br>
Compare the three hill shade surfaces, and discuss your findings in your report.<br>

<h3>Interpolate surface using Radial Basis Functions</h3>
Use the Geostatistical Analyst tool's Radial Basis Functions to generate at least
two different elevation surfaces by selecting different Kernel functions.<br>
In the first surface you'll use the RBF multi-quadric method.<br>
In the second, you'll choose Regularized Spline.

<pre>
Check out a Geostatistical Analyst Extension license
Customize->Toolbars->Geostatistical Analysis'
Select 'Geostatistical Analysis->Geostatistical Wizard'
Select the 'Deterministic Methods->Radial Basis Functions' method
Set the 'Source Dataset' to 'elev_lid792_randpts'
Set the Data Field to 'value_'
Click 'Next'
Set the Kernel function to 'Multiquadric'
Click Next/Finish/OK through remainder of dialogs
</pre>

<p>
Rerun the interpolation in the Geostatistical Analyst Wizard using<br>
 Kernal Type = Completely Regularized Spline and compare your results.
