<h2>Geospatial Data Introduction</h2>

<p>
Instructions:
LMC, RMC mean left and right mouse click.

The geodatabases: ncshape.mdb, ncrast.mdb. If you don't already have these
geodatabases downloaded, you can find them on
<a href="../logistics.html#data">Course logistics page</a>.
<p>
You can put the geodatabases in any suitable directory where you have permissions to write
and in these instructions we will refer to this directory C:\Users\myname\arcdata.
<p>
Move both geodatabases to the directory: C:\Users\myname\arcdata

<h3>Data management</h3>
Start ArcMap:  Start->Programs->ArcGIS->ArcMap 10.
Click the Cancel button to dismiss the Getting Started dialog.

<p>
Adding data to ArcMap:
Add the Bridges feature class (located in ncshape.mdb) to your project.
Examine the descriptive attributes associated with the bridge features.

<pre>
RMC on the Bridges entry in the Table of Contents and select Open Attribute Table from
the context menu.</pre>
<ul><li>How many attributes (data fields) are associated with the Bridges feature class?</li>
<li>How many bridges are shown in the Bridges feature class?</li></ul>


<p>
Create a new geodatabase to store data:

<pre>
Find the Catalog tab along the right side of the ArcMap map window and LMC to expand.
Navigate in the catalog tree to C:\Users\myname\arcdata.
Create a new folder called 'Assign1' in the arcdata folder.
RMC on the newly minted Assign1 folder icon in the Catalog window and
choose New -> File Geodatabase from the context menu.
Name it 'Assign1'.
</pre>

<p>
Copy data from one geodatabase to another:

<pre>
Open ncshape.mdb geodatabase in the [Arc]catalog tree
LMC on ncshape.mdb to open it.
</pre>

<p>
Copy a feature class from one geodatabase to another:

<pre>
Find and RMC bridges->Copy.
Navigate to the Assign1 geodatabase; On the geodatabase icon: RMC -> Paste.
Click 'OK' in the Data Transfer dialog.
</pre>
<p>
Note: you can also remove the data layer using the same menu

<p>
Convert a feature class to a shape file:

<pre>
Open ncshape.mdb in the ArcCatalog window.
RMC bridges->Export->To Shapefile (single).
Set Output Location to C:\Users\myname\arcdata\Assign1 (your Assign1 folder).
Set output Feature Class to 'bridges_shp'.
Click 'OK'.
</pre>

<h3>Data view and symbology</h3>
<p>
Adding Raster Data into Data Frame:

<pre>
File->Data->Add Data...
Navigate to the ncrast.mdb geodatabase and add the elev raster layer
</pre>

<p>
Turn the Bridges Layers Off:

<pre>
LMC the check boxes (to remove the existing checks) next to each
of the three bridge entries in the TOC.
</pre>

<p>
Zoom to the elev raster layer:

<pre>
RMC on elev and select Zoom to Layer
</pre>

<p>
Change color scheme:

<pre>
RMC elev->Properties and select the 'Symbology' tab
Change the Color Ramp (Color Ramp drop down menu) to one that
represents elevation intuitively (it makes sense to you)
</pre>

<p>
Add hillshade data into the data frame:

<pre>
File->Data->Add Data...
Add elev_sh from the ncrast.mdb geodatabase
</pre>

<p>
Change the transparency of the hillshade:

<pre>
RMC elev_sh->Properties
Click on the 'Display' Tab
Set Transparency to 70%
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Display vector points and lines:

<pre>
File->Data->Add Data...
Add streets_wake, roadsmajor, schools_wake from the ncshape.mdb geodatabase
Hint: press and hold the control key to add multiple data layers
</pre>

<p>
Change the line style:

<pre>
RMC roadsmajor->Properties and select 'Symbology' tab
Click on the button displaying the current symbol
Change the color to red and the width to 1.6
Click 'OK'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Change the point style:

<pre>
LMC directly on the symbol for schools_wake in the Table of Contents (shortcut to the
symbol selector)
Select 'School 1' It's about half way down in the symbol palette
Change the size to 14
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Trim the Vector Display to Match the Raster's Geographic Extent:

<pre>
RMC Layers at the top of the TOC
Select Properties->Data Frame->Clip Options->Clip to shape
LMC Specify Shape button
LMC Custom Extent
Uncheck the Degrees Check box
Enter the following in the top, bottom, left, and right fields,
respectively: 228500, 215000, 630000, 645000. (FYI: These coordinates define
the geographic extent of the elev and elev_sh raster layers.)
Click 'OK'
Click 'OK'
</pre>

<p>
Your display should now clip the roads and schools data so that these only:
display in the are covered by the elev and hillshade rasters.

<p>
Save the map for your report:

<pre>
LMC File->Export map  (Save the file to your Assign1 workspace as pdf or png)
</pre>

<p>
Exit ArcMap. You can choose to save your project, if you wish, however, it's not necessary.
