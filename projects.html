</ul>

Follow structure of a peer reviewed publication:

<ul>
    <li><b>Introduction/Background</b>: brief literature review, motivation for the research, research question / objective</li>
    <li><b>Study site</b>: where, why, geographic characteristics</li>

Further notes:
  <ul>
    <li>Use scientific language (no “visually pleasing results”, please)</li>
    <li>Spelling errors are unacceptable</li>
    <li>Images: make sure that all grid cells are rendered when it is important - both for 2D and in 3D, both in ArcGIS and GRASS GIS or convert to vector if you have line features that need to be preserved. Use well designed color tables and sufficient number of classes in ArcGIS to avoid losing information in maps.</li>
    <li>You may find this <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/11-steps-to-structuring-a-science-paper-editors-will-take-seriously"> advice on how to write a scientific paper</a> helpful.

<h4>Data</h4>

You can find potential data for your project in this list of
<a href="resources/data_providers.html">data providers</a>.


<h3>Topics</h3>

You can use a topic from your thesis or expand a project that you have
worked on in other classes, but make sure that your <em>project
includes a component that requires processing and/or analysis of continuous field(s)</em>,
such as elevation, precipitation, chemical concentrations, etc.
<p>
You can collaborate on the projects, for example by studying different regions
and then compare the results. Or you can select
a common area (e.g. SW Wake county) and do several analyses related to sustainability
and energy efficiency, for example design biking paths and electric vehicle routes,
map solar energy potential, map areas with high runoff potential that need
land use change, and asses erosion risk for areas with planned development.
<p>
If you do not have a project that you could use as a starting point,
bellow are some ideas you can use.
<p>
If you are already using GIS in your work, you are
encouraged to pick a topic from the development, documentation and
testing category to move your skills to the next level.
